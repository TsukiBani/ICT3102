16,A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!,,,,,
17,A pretty good product.,,,,,

33,All in all,,,,,
34,All in all I think it was a good investment.,,,,,
35,All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,,,,,
36,All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.,,,,,
37,All three broke within two months of use.,,,,,

729,The BT headset was such a disapoinment.,,,,,
730,The buttons for on and off are bad.,,,,,
731,The cable looks so thin and flimsy,,,,,
732,The calls drop,,,,,
733,The camera,,,,,
734,The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.,,,,,

742,The construction of the headsets is poor.,,,,,
743,The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.,,,,,
744,The delivery was on time.,,,,,
745,The design is very good.4.,,,,,
746,The design is very odd,,,,,
747,The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,,,,,
748,The ear buds only play music in one ear.,,,,,
749,The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.,,,,,
750,The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.,,,,,
751,The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.,,,1,,

753,The handsfree part works fine,,,,,
754,The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.,,,,,

760,The internet access was fine,,,,,
761,The item received was Counterfeit.,,,,,
762,The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.,,,,,

765,The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear,,,,,
766,The loudspeaker option is great,,,,,
767,The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.,,,,,

771,The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.,,,,,
772,The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.,,,,,
773,The noise shield is incrediable.,,,,,
774,The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.,,,,,
775,The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.,,,,,
776,The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.,,,,,
777,The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).,,,,,
778,The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.,,,,,
779,the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!,,,,,
780,The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.,,,,,

790,The pleather case doesn't fit.,,,,,
791,The plug did not work very well.,,,,,
792,The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.,,,,,

794,The real killer is the volume,,,,,
795,The reception has been generally good.,,,,,
796,The reception is excellent!,,,,,
797,The reception through this headset is excellent.,,,,,

802,The shipping time was also very quick!,,,,,
803,The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.,,,,,
804,The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area,,,,,
805,The sound quality is excellent as well.,,,,,
806,The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.,,,,,
807,The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.,,,,,
808,The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.,,,,,
809,The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate,,,,,
810,The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.,,,,,
811,The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.,,,,,
812,The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).,,,,,

814,the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.,,,,,

816,The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.,,,,,
817,Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.,,,,,
818,Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.,,,,,
819,Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.,,,,,
820,Then I exchanged for the same phone,,,,,
821,Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.,,,,,
822,There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best,,, many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.,1
823,There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.,,,,,
824,There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.,,,,,
825,These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.,,,,,
826,These are fabulous!,,,,,
827,These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.,,,,,
828,These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.,,,,,
829,THey are so cool!,,,,,
830,They do not care about the consumer one bit.,,,,,
831,They do not last forever,,,,,

834,They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.,,,,,
835,They refuse to refund or replace.,,,,,
836,They work about 2 weeks then break.,,,0,,
837,Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,,,,,

839,This battery is an excellent bargain!,,,,,
840,This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.,,,,,
841,This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear,,,,,
842,This case seems well made.,,,,,
